# Exploratory Data Analysis and Clustering & Predictive Modelling preformed on parkinsons dataset

This project involves the exploration and analysis of a dataset to perform predictive analytics tasks. 

### Dataset and Predictive Analytics Task

- Selected one predictive analytics task based on the chosen dataset.

 Exploratory Data Analysis and Clustering:
   - Performed exploratory data analysis on the chosen dataset.
   - Applied a clustering algorithm to the dataset and visualize the clustering results.
   - Discussed the usefulness of the clustering approach in enhancing the understanding of underlying patterns within the dataset. 
   
 Predictive Modeling:
   - Implemented at least three different machine learning algorithms to train a predictive model (classification/regression) based on the chosen task.
   - Selected the best model among the attempted algorithms.
   - Justified your choice in a markdown cell and provided an explanation of the decision-making process 
   - Aim wa to build a model that is as effective as possible for addressing the formulated problem. During this process, we employed various data preparation and feature selection strategies based on the dataset's nature.
